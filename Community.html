	<h2>Our Community Goal</h2>
</center>
<center>
<p>A very distinct feature we have on our education site is focusing on community. Here at World Education, we not only educate the world on the most pressing global matters, but also connect students from all over the world to converse with each other what they have learned and how it can be applied. </p>
